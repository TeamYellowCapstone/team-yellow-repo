            <p> We've progressed from beans simmered in a shelled nut roaster to a variety of smooth, tasty mixtures sold across the country. </p>
            <h3> It All Began Here  </h3>
            <p> In Columbus,, we began as Sister`sÂ Coffee, preparing shockingly smooth espresso with only a 12-pound shelled nut roaster. 
            We quickly outgrew our small roaster and relocated to beautiful Westerville, where we continued to roast and blend delicious espresso. </p>
            <h3> Becoming Successful </h3>
            <p> We competed for the title of "some espresso in Columbus," and when our silky smooth flavor won us the title, we changed our name to Love You a Latte. </p>
